### Project Goals

In this project I was given a web-based application that read RSS feeds. The
goal was to use Jasmine to write test suites that would test the functionality
of the application. The requirments were to:

Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it
has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it
has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to
analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the
hiding/showing of the menu element.

Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is
clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when
clicked and does it hide when clicked again.

Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".

Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its
work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.

Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".

Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function
that the content actually changes.

When complete - all of your tests should pass.
