### Project Goals

In this project I was given a web-based application that read RSS feeds. The
goal was to use Jasmine to write test suites that would test the functionality
of the application. The requirements were to:

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures
   it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures
   it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

3. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

4. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is
   clicked.

5. Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".

6. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes
   its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed
   container.

8. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function
   that the content actually changes.
